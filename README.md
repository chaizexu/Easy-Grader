# Easy-Grader
The EZgrader is a state of the art grading system, emphasizing the needs of a teaching professional, while minimizing the complexity of modern-day organizational tools like Excel. With our product, teachers and professors alike have the ability to create courses with assignments that weigh themselves automatically, use a class statistics generator with a click of a button, and be able to pull up information about any student by merely selecting their name. With the EZgrader, the everyday nuisances that a teaching professional has with their current grading system become nil.
